# Quantos blockchain
### This repository contains code for the v0.1.0 of Quantos. Work in progress, not completed yet.

There is probably still a lot of bugs and nonsense as it is constantly evolving. Not even a beta version. 

Some of the features that are planned or worked on includes : 

- Fast transaction time (goal: 26,000+ tps)
- Stable fees, let's end the craziness of paying $50 for a $20 transaction
- Dpos based on more than just staking (per example age of account and other criteria that is making it more fair)
- Use of latest algorithms such as kyber-crystal
- Anonymous encryption schemes
- Schnorr signatures
- Smart contracts (wysiwyg interface? would be nice so its easier for non coders or newcomers to participate and having less bugs)
- Ability to make transaction data anonymous to protect per example medical records or other sensitive data

That list is not exhaustive, more will be added to it. It is only a glimpse. 

## Get a diagram instead of reading the code ;)

I did include a diagram option in the makefile. All you need is to get goplantuml from here: https://github.com/jfeliu007/goplantuml and use
a viewer such as : https://www.planttext.com/ or integrated in an ide (im using jetbrain goland). 

Here is how to do it (after following the instructions to install goplantuml: 

- Clone the repository
- switch to the directory it was cloned to 
- type: make diagram

and voila! a file called quantos.puml will be generated which you can paste or open in a viewer :)

if you believe in the project so much and want to invest in it, feel free to make an offer. However I would suggest anyone who would like to do so to wait until a testnet version is at least available.
